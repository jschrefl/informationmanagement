<h5>Content oft he Page:</h5>
HTML5 / HTML<p></p>

2. Warnings: &lt;details&gt; (same as above)<p></p>

<h5>Changes:</h5>
3 small tags where set wrong. &lt;p /&gt; is not right (but works). The right way to do it is: &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
<h5>Importance of standards:</h5>
Example Internet Explorer:<p></p>
The reason why web-developers don’t like IE is because they (=Microsoft) did not follow any standards for a long time. IE9 now follows some standards but does not support all features yet. If a browser does not follow certain rules how HTML and CSS code is interpreted a web-page will look different of every browser. Therefore web-developers have to write code again, just so that their website (that already looks great on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera) looks great on Internet Explorer. Resume: Developers need more time (and money) to develop websites, only because Microsoft doesn’t follow all the web-standards.<p></p>

A quote from Mark Zuckeberg:
<blockquote>I mean, we've built a lot of products that we think are good, and will help people share photos and share videos and write messages to each other. But it's really all about how people are spreading Facebook around the world in all these different countries. And that's what's so amazing about the scale that it's at today.<p> </p>
